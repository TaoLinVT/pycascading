# to Hadoop. We assume we have SSH access to this server.
server=localhost

# This is the folder on the remote server where the PyCascading modules and
# jars will be cached. $HOME is only expanded on the remote server.
# Don't call it 'pycascading', as if we run a script from $HOME, some modules
# will be attempted to be imported from this folder!
server_home_dir='$HOME/.pycascading'

# This is the folder on the remote server where a temporary directory is
# going to be created for the submission.
server_deploys_dir="$server_home_dir/deploys"

# The folder on the remote server where the PyCascading master jar will be
# placed. This must be given as an absolute path name so that the master
# files can be found from any directory.

Usage: $(basename "$0") [options] <main_script> [additional_files]

The main_script gets executed by PyCascading. All additional_files are also
copied to the remote server and submitted together with the job to Hadoop.

Options:
   -h                Show this message.

   -m                Also deploy the PyCascading master archives before submitting
                     the job. The master archives must be on the Hadoop server
                     before a job can be run.

   -f <file>         Copy file to the server together with main_script, but
                     do not bundle it up for submission. This option may be
                     repeated several times for multiple files. File names
                     cannot start with a dot. This is useful if we need some
                     files to set up the flow, but not on every mapper/reducer.

   -s <server>       The name of the remote server where Hadoop is installed,
                     and the PyCascading scripts should be deployed to.

   -o <ssh_options>  Additional options for SSH (such as private key, etc.).
                     ssh_options is one string enclosed by "s or 's, even if
                     there are several parameters.

   -O <hadoop_opts>  Additional Hadoop options to be put in the running script.

   -r                Run the job immediately after submission with SSH. The
                     recommended way to run a script is either using screen
                     or nohup, so that the job doesn't get interrupted if the
                     terminal connection goes down. Note that no additional
                     command line parameters can be passed in this case for
                     the job.

   -R <args>         Run the job immediately after submisison with SSH. The
                     next parameter is taken to be the arguements which should
                     be passed to the script.
